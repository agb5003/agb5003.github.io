## Problem 1

First, we want to plot the curve of the function:

$$ f(x) = sin^2(x) \cdot exp\left(-\cfrac{x}{2}\right) + 0.01x - 0.1 $$

To do this, we first define the domain for x:

~~~matlab
x = 0:0.1:10;
~~~

and define y as a function of x, i.e., $ y = f(x) $:

~~~matlab
y = sin(x).^2.*exp(-x/2)+0.01.*x-0.1;
~~~

With the arrays for x and y defined, we can now plot the curve:

~~~matlab
plot(x,y)
~~~

Running the program, we find this graph, completing the first problem:

## Problem 2

Next, we want to find the roots to the equation:

$$ sin^2(x) \cdot exp\left(-\cfrac{x}{2}\right) + 0.01x - 0.1 = 0, (x\geq0) $$

It's obvious that this equation is the function in the first problem, but with $f(x)=0$. The roots of the equation are the $x$-coordinates of where the curve intersects the $x$-axis, or also called the $y = 0$ line. We can intuitively see that the curve crosses the $ y = 0 $ line several times. To make these intercepts clearer, we draw a line for $y = 0$. To do this, define a one-row array called `intercept` and filling it with zeros everywhere on `x`. We then change the plot line to also include `(x,intercept)`. We make the curve and line different colors to better distinguish them.

~~~matlab
intercept = zeros(1,length(x));
plot(x, y, "m", x , intercept)
~~~

However, we don't know if the curve keeps crossing over the line or not without calculating. To visually confirm if there are no more roots in the domain $x \geq0$, we can extend the array where we defined x to be longer. We can then see more of the curve.

~~~matlab
x = 0:0.1:20; % extending x array to 20
y = sin (x).^2.*exp(-x/2)+0.01.*x-0.1;
intercept = zeros(1,length(x)); % Draw a line for y = 0 to find intercepts
plot(x, y, "m", x , intercept);
~~~

As we can see from this extended plot, the curve diverges from the $x$-axis, which means it won't cross the line again after the point around $x=10$.

At first glance, there seems to be 6 points where the curve intersects the x axis. However, upon closer inspection, there really only are 5.

Zooming in on the point close to $x=8$:

While it is close, the curve does not quite touch the line.

### Finding initial guesses to put in `x0`
To get the actual values of the roots, we need to use `fsolve`, as the equation is nonlinear. However, `fsolve` requires us to make initial guesses about where the roots are, and these initial guesses have to be somewhat close to the actual point. Luckily, we have the plot as a tool.

Zooming in on the intersects:

The first intersect is around $x = 0.3$.

The second intersect is around $x = 2.6$.

The third intersect is around $x = 3.8$.

The fourth intersect is around $x = 5.3$.

The fifth and final intersect is around $x = 9.8$.

With these values, we construct an array `x0`:

~~~matlab
x0 = [0.3; 2.6; 3.8; 5.3]
~~~

Now we declare a function `y = f(x)` for the left side of the equation.

~~~matlab
function y = f(x)
  y = sin (x).^2.*exp(-x/2)+0.01.*x-0.1;
end
~~~


In order to find the roots of $f(x)$, we can use `fsolve` in this manner:

~~~matlab
result = fsolve(@f, x0)
~~~

Which in turn outputs the following as answers.

~~~matlab
>> CAPS_04_C2TB1702_roots

ans =

   0.3456
   2.5941
   3.8480
   5.3244
   9.8677
~~~

## Checking validity of answers

To check the validity of our result, we can plug in the $x$-values we get and see if we get $f(x) = 0$.

~~~matlab
x = result;
y = sin (x).^2.*exp(-x/2)+0.01.*x-0.1
~~~

Running this after getting the result from our `fsolve` script outputs:

~~~matlab
>> CAPS_04_C2TB1702_check

y =

   1.6067e-06
   2.8132e-10
  -1.4310e-08
   4.1089e-09
   1.3504e-09
~~~

These values are very close to zero, validating our `fsolve` script.
